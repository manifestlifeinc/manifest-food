# Outpost 

An experiment with Watson Conversation, Watson Natural Language and Yelp

Primarily, this is a Watson Conversation chatbot that you can ask questions about food and restauarants to. 

For instance: 'find me pizza', or 'I feel like steak'

Secondarily it is an app that uses a conversation model to understand mentions of food, and classifications of food from a twitter stream.
